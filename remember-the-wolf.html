    <h2>Remember the Wolf</h2>
    <p>
      We walk through life<br>
      pretending the wolf isn’t there.<br><br>

      It keeps its distance<br>
      quiet paws,<br>
      steady eyes,<br>
      no need to chase what is already moving toward it.<br><br>

      We convince ourselves<br>
      it will come only when we are old,<br>
      when our bones are ready.<br>
      As if we decide<br>
      when the wolf is allowed to arrive.<br><br>

      But the wolf has never left.<br>
      It stalks us from the first breath,<br>
      not as a threat,<br>
      but as a truth.<br><br>

      Still, we forget.<br>
      Until it sinks its teeth<br>
      into someone we love.<br>
      Then we remember-<br>
      and fear it,<br>
      curse it,<br>
      call it cruel.<br><br>

      But the wolf does not hate.<br>
      It does not hunt out of malice.<br>
      It simply walks.<br><br>

      To fear the wolf<br>
      is to misunderstand the forest.<br>
      To pretend it isn't there<br>
      is to pretend we do not live.<br><br>

      Let it walk beside you.<br>
      Let its presence soften you.<br>
      Let it calm you.<br><br>

      One day,<br>
      you will lie down<br>
      and it will come close-<br>
      not to punish,<br>
      but to carry you<br>
      back into the quiet.<br><br>

      Back to what you were<br>
      before you ever ran.<br><br>

      Remember the wolf.
